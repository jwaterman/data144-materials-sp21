    "### Project\n",
    "\n",
    "Your project is to develop a Jupyter Notebook **and** to record 5 to 7 minute video presentation addressing a research question that can be answered using a hypothesis test (and relevant confidence intervals) or regression inferences. Your research question should be related to **climate change**, broadly defined. This is a group project, and you can form a team of 3 students to complete your group project.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "\n",
    "On Moodle, we provide 8 different climate data sources to help you get started. Feel free to use any of these 8 sources, or collect your own data or find a dataset of your interest online or from another source. We've created [a short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3_Y_IljHws&list=PLD3O7TkAb6rRArZKmKs3_QqDsuyiYDwBP&index=47) to walk you through the steps of downloading a .csv data file and uploading it to your Jupyter workspace.\n",
    "\n",
    "Avoid using population datasets (such as data from all countries, all counties, etc.) – the purpose of this project is to do **inference**, which means you should be starting with sample data. If you collect your own data and your sampling method isn’t perfect, or find a dataset where you are worried the data may not have been sampled randomly, you may still use the dataset with appropriate discussion of the shortcomings of the study, biases, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other Data Sources\n",
    "\n",
    "While this class is part of the Grand Challenges Program on climate change, we realize that covid-19 has impacted all of us.  If you wish to do a project using covid-19 data instead of climate data, we are able to accommodate that request.  Here are two sources of covid-19 data. \n",

    "Write as if you are explaining your results to whomever would be interested in your research question, whether this is other scholars in your field or peers sharing your interest in the topic. Keep in mind this audience may or may not have taken data science. You must be accurate and use correct data science terminology, but must also explain your conclusions in a way that anyone can understand.\n",

    "The first thing you must do is pick your teams!  Form your team soon and **each team member** needs to fill out [this form](https://forms.gle/87LBcWhGj74Wjboo7) by Sunday 4/18 11:59pm.  If you don't fill out this form by the deadline, you will be assigned to a group randomly.  Once you form your team, we will create a team Jupyterhub account (and a copy of this notebook) for your team.  This will be the account where you will work on your project together.  Your team members can share data and notebooks in this account.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**The final deadline for the project is Sunday 5/23 11:59pm**. Your deliveriables are the Jupyter notebook you used to generate your results and a 5-7 video presentation of your work.  It's **much** better to be early than late, so please start working now.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Checkpoint.** For full credit, you must complete the checkpoint by the checkpoint deadline. To complete the checkpoint, you must answer all questions up until the end of Part 3 and submit them by Sunday 5/2 11:59pm. You will **not** have lab time to work on these questions, we recommend that you start early on each part to stay on track.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Support.** You are not alone! Come to office hours, and post questions on Slack.  We will set up a private slack channel for each group to help with coordination.  Feel free to talk about high-level concepts with your classmates, but the work on your project must your own and the members of your group. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Advice.** Develop your codes incrementally. To perform a complicated table manipulation, break it up into steps, perform each step on a different line, give a new name to each result, and check that each intermediate result is what you expect. You can add any additional names or functions you want to the provided cells. \n",
